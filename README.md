Hi, I’m Karoly

I’m a developer who genuinely enjoys building things from the ground up. There’s something satisfying about taking an idea, breaking it down, and slowly turning it into something real. I like digging into problems, experimenting, hitting walls, and eventually finding the solution that actually works, not just the one that works “well enough.”

Most of what I know comes from teaching myself, trying things, messing up, and trying again. I’ve finished frontend and full-stack courses, and I have a BSc in engineering, but my real growth came from hours of figuring things out on my own. I don’t have a traditional IT degree, but I’ve learned how to learn quickly, and that’s helped me keep up with people who do.

What motivates me most is building something useful—something that makes someone’s life easier or solves a real problem. I don’t get excited about generic “starter apps.” I’d rather work on something messy and challenging. I’ve done paid projects, but honestly, some of my favorite work has been things I built simply because they were interesting or because I wanted to understand how something worked.

I try to be resourceful. I don’t always know the right answer immediately, but I’m good at finding it. I use tools like AI—not as a crutch, but as a tool that helps me move faster and think more clearly. It frees me up to focus on design, architecture, and actual problem-solving instead of trying to memorize every last bit of syntax.

I could list the tools and technologies I know, but anyone can do that. I’d rather someone browse my portfolio and see what I’ve actually built.

Freelancing has taught me to be independent, disciplined, and reliable. I’m not a “vibe coder.” I’m someone who likes to understand the problem, choose the right tools, and then just sit down and build.
